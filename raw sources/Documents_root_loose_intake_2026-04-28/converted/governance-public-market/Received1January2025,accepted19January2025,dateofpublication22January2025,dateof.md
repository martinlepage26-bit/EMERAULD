ABSTRACT Agentic AI, an emerging paradigm in artificial intelligence, refers to autonomous systems
designedtopursuecomplexgoalswithminimalhumanintervention.UnliketraditionalAI,whichdependson
structuredinstructionsandcloseoversight,AgenticAIdemonstratesadaptability,advanceddecision-making
capabilitiesandself-sufficiency,enablingittooperatedynamicallyinevolvingenvironments.Thissurvey
thoroughly explores the foundational concepts, unique characteristics, and core methodologies driving
the development of Agentic AI. We examine its current and potential applications across various fields,
including healthcare, finance, and adaptive software systems, emphasizing the advantages of deploying
agenticsystemsinreal-worldscenarios.ThepaperalsoaddressestheethicalchallengesposedbyAgentic
AI,proposingsolutionsforgoalalignment,resourceconstraints,andenvironmentaladaptability.Weoutline
a framework for safely and effectively integrating Agentic AI into society, highlighting the need for
further research on ethical considerations to ensure beneficial societal impacts. This survey serves as a
comprehensiveintroductiontoAgenticAI,guidingresearchers,developers,andpolicymakersinengaging
